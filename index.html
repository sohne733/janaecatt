    <p class="hover-text">I’ve seen and heard Janae sing many times at Union Square Station, and her powerful, beautiful voice always draws me in. Every time I pass by, she’s performing a familiar song, and I find myself quietly singing along, captivated by her magic. One day, as I took this photo, I truly immersed myself in her performance. For a moment, I stepped out of the city's relentless rush and admired the stage Janae had created in the bustling subway. Her music became an oasis amid the chaos, cutting through the noise and connecting people who were otherwise lost in their routines. Janae’s voice had a way of transforming the station, turning it from a place of urgency into one of calm. Commuters paused to listen, their faces softening as the hectic pace slowed, replaced by the soothing sound of her voice. I realized how music can connect strangers, turning an ordinary subway stop into a space of shared connection. Janae’s performances are more than just displays of talent; they bring people together, reminding us that even in the busiest places, art can create bonds and touch lives.</p>
